    (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
    entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%)
    or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n\"You\"
    (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
    granted by this License.\r\n\r\n\"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form
    for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.\r\n\r\n\"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting
    from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions
    to other media types.\r\n\r\n\"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether
    in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided
    in the Appendix below).\r\n\r\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether
    in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for
    which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this
    License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from,
    or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
    Works thereof.\r\n\r\n\"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work
    or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion

    to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
    \"submitted\" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication
    on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
    that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
    and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
    or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Contributor\"
    shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution
    has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.\r\n\r\n2.
    Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works
    of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and
    such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\r\n\r\n3. Grant of Patent License.
    Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
    to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer
    to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
    only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
    litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
    alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
    direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
    You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
    is filed.\r\n\r\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
    and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\nYou
    must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
    License; and\r\n\r\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\nYou must retain, in the Source
    form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark,
    and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\nIf the Work
    includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative
    Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
    within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
    the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
    or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
    notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
    purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum
    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement
    to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and
    conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for
    any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution
    of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5.
    Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall
    be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms
    or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
    regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant
    permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
    of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
    the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n7.
    Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
    Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on
    an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express
    or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
    solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing
    the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under
    this License.\r\n\r\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal
    theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
    required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
    agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
    arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n9.
    Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
